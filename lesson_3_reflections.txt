When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  I would want to use a remote reposity for every project that revisions will be made by myself and/or others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Pulling changes manually vs automatically allows me to make changes to the commit prior to the pull.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks are copies of the original respository via GitHub.
	Clones are copies of the original repository to local via Git.
	Branches are a way to test a modification without changing the master on the local via Git.
