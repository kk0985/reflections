When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  I would want to use a remote reposity for every project that revisions will be made by myself and/or others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Pulling changes manually vs automatically allows me to make changes to the commit prior to the pull.
