When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  I would want to use a remote reposity for every project that revisions will be made by myself and/or others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Pulling changes manually vs automatically allows me to make changes to the commit prior to the pull.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks are copies of the original respository via GitHub.
	Clones are copies of the original repository to local via Git.
	Branches are a way to test a modification without changing the master on the local via Git.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	Having a copy of the last know stte of the remote stored locally is beneficial because the copy allows me to find any conflicts when working with the master.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	Email would be used to send docs back and forth or a respository like Box or Dropbox would be used.  Git/GitHub would be easier because it allows for instant updates over internet; sending emails would be harder because it is more time consuming
