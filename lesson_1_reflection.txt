How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

    diff allowed me to efficiently and quickly locate the bug

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

    easy access to the entire history of a file will allow me to see if elements in another version are missing from current version

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

    Manually choosing when to create a commit ensures that a meaningful save is made. For example a commit made after each logical change gives me one purpose that can be easily understood. Automatic commits could result in confusion because a partial line of code could be saved.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git allows saving multiple files in one commit because they are inter related while Google Docs treats each file separately because those files are not inter related.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log provides the list of commits make; git diff shows the specific changes that were made

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

    being able to return to a previous version makes me confident that if I do break something I will be able to find the break and correct it.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    anything and everything
